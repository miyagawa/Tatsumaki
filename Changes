Revision history for Perl extension Tatsumaki

0.1013  Thu Jul  7 11:49:18 PDT 2011
        - Added $self->binary(1) in Handler classes to indicate binary responses (gbarr, mateu)
        - Allow $self->json to be set to customize the way JSON is encoded (ask)

0.1012  Sun Feb 13 20:01:46 PST 2011
        - No code changes. Updated terribly outdated Tatsumaki.pm POD

0.1011  Tue Dec 21 11:49:49 PST 2010
        - Fixed to use $r->parameters to make it work with newer Plack::Request
        - Fixed MessageQueue leak when long-poll client immediately reconnects after disconnection (mash)

0.1010  Wed Apr  7 15:48:43 PDT 2010
        - INCOMPATIBLE: '/' in the mapping matches only with '/'. If you need the catch-all behavior,
          use '/.*' instead.
        - special case favicon.ico to serve from static/ directory
        - Handlers now handle HEAD the same as GET by default

0.1009  Tue Mar  2 14:31:15 PST 2010
        - Fixed a rare condition where response starter returns something and garbage
          collection breaks.
        - Fixed dependency and depend on Twiggy not Plack::Server::AnyEvent (zamolxes)
        - Removed BlockingFallback middleware

0.1008  Sun Jan 31 14:16:02 PST 2010

0.1007  Tue Dec 22 10:07:18 PST 2009
        - Make Test::Warn test optional

0.1006  Fri Dec 18 06:45:57 PST 2009
        - Fixed a bug in ->psgi_app where it could potentially let $app object disappear

0.1005  Sat Dec 12 00:57:20 PST 2009
        - Fixed services conflicts with the latest Moose (hiratara)
        - Use path_info rather than path to dispatch
        - Push buffered events immediately in long-poll (hiratara)
        - Fixed params bug where multiple values are flattened (ingy)

0.1002  Mon Nov 16 18:03:50 PST 2009
        - Remove client ID from MXHR example because it's not needed
        - Specify lowest Mouse deps to make it work
        - Delay load Text::MicroTemplate so you can use other template engines like TT2 (ingydotnet)
