        - Added $self->binary(1) in Handler classes to indicate binary responses (gbarr, mateu)

0.1012  Sun Feb 13 20:01:46 PST 2011

0.1011  Tue Dec 21 11:49:49 PST 2010
        - Fixed to use $r->parameters to make it work with newer Plack::Request

0.1010  Wed Apr  7 15:48:43 PDT 2010
        - INCOMPATIBLE: '/' in the mapping matches only with '/'. If you need the catch-all behavior,
          use '/.*' instead.

        - Handlers now handle HEAD the same as GET by default

        - Removed BlockingFallback middleware

        - Remove client ID from MXHR example because it's not needed
        - Specify lowest Mouse deps to make it work
